FSD_Saenz_*: contains
file contains final state distribution of T2a nd HT based on table 1 in:
@Article{PhysRevLett.84.242,
  title = {Improved Molecular Final-State Distribution of $HeT+$ for the $\beta{}$-Decay Process of $T2$},
  author = {Saenz, Alejandro  and Jonsell, Svante  and Froelich, Piotr },
  journal = {Phys. Rev. Lett.},
  volume = {84},
  number = {2},
  pages = {242--245},

note that for T2 is a more up to date FSD available (Phys. Rev. C73n 025502(2006).


Ji... files:

binned data files compiled by Natasha Doss (May 05);
ASCII files containing FSD for (^3He-T)+ and (^3He-D) molecules in a common energy scale (the energy scale of T2; different recoils already corrected).
First column: weighted energy;
Second column: probability per 0.01eV bin

files are from the BSCW

FSD_DOSS*
contains new FSD, rebinned to match more or less the calculation in PhysRevLett.84.
there is a significant difference between 45 and 50 eV in comparison to Saenz et al. (WHY?)
